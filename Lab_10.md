# Objectives:
1. To build problem solving skills involving Sorting Algorithms

---

## Problem 1:
a) Write `mergeSort(…)` recursive function as studied in the lecture.

b) Modify the function `merge(..)` done in the previous lab. As is required by the `mergeSort` function written in part a) above.

c) Write `main(..)` function to test the `mergeSort(..)` & `merge(..)` functions written in above.

---

## Problem 2:
a) Write `insertionSort(…)` function as studied in the lecture.

b) Write `main(..)` function to test the function written in part a) above.

---

## Problem 3:
 a) Write `partition(…)` function which partitions the array passed to it as studied in the lecture.

 b) Write `main(..)` function to test the function written in part a) above.

---

## Problem 4:
Write a function `sort(…)` which sorts an array of integers. The array is populated by only two numbers: 1 and 3. The function shall sort the array in O(N) time.
### Example:
**Array:**  
1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3

**Sorted Array:**  
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
