# Problem 2

### Task:
Write a member function `deleteNode` in the `DLList` class (from Problem 1) that accepts a `key` and deletes the node containing the `key` from the doubly linked list, if the key is present in the list. Then, test the `deleteNode` function in the `main()` program.

# Problem 3

### Task:
Write a member function `length` in the `DLList` class (from Problem 1) to count the number of nodes in the linked list. Then, test it (the `length` function) in the `main()` program.

---

# Problem 4

### Task:
Write a member function `empty` in the `DLList` class (from Problem 1) that returns `true` if the linked list is empty, otherwise `false`. Then, test it (the `empty` function) in the `main()` program.
