# Objectives:
1. To complete the Binary Search Tree class
2. To solve problems related to Binary Trees

---

# Problem 1

### Task:
Write a `delete` function in the `BSTree` class and test its working.

---

# Problem 2

### Task:
Write a member function, `size()`, in the `BSTree` class. The `size()` function returns the number of nodes in the `BSTree` object. This function shall be written as a recursive function.

**Note:** Use of a data member which holds the number of nodes in an object is not allowed.

---

# Problem 3

### Task:
Write a member function, `height()`, in the `BSTree` class. The `height()` function returns the height of the `BSTree` object. This function shall be written as a recursive function.
