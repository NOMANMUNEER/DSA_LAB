# Problem Solving: Singly Linked List (SLL)

## Problem 2: Delete Node by Key

Write a member function `deleteNode` in the **SLList** class (from Problem 1) that accepts a key and deletes the node containing the key from the list if the key is present.

---

## Problem 3: Length of the List

Write a member function `length` in the **SLList** class (from Problem 1) to count the number of nodes in a singly linked list.

---

## Problem 4: Check if the List is Empty

Write a member function `empty` in the **SLList** class (from Problem 1) that returns `true` if the singly linked list is empty, otherwise `false`.

---

## Problem 5: Find a Value in the List

Write a member function `find` in the **SLList** class (from Problem 1) that accepts a value and returns `true` if the value is present in the singly linked list, otherwise `false`.
