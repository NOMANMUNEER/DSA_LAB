# Objectives:
1. To build problem solving skills.

---

## Problem 1:
a) Write a recursive function, `binarySearch(…)`, that accepts a sorted array of integers (non-increasing/decreasing order) and a key. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the key in the array. If the key is not found in the array, it returns -1. The Time Complexity of the function shall be O(log N).

b) Write `main(…)` function to test the function written in part a) above.

---

## Problem 2:
Write a function `sort(…)` which sorts an array of integers. The array is populated by only three numbers: a₁, a₂, and a₃. The function shall sort the array in O(N) time.
### Example:
**Array:**  
-1, 11, 31, -1, -1, 31, 31, 11, -1, 11, 31

**Sorted Array:**  
-1, -1, -1, -1, 11, 11, 11, 31, 31, 31, 31
## Problem 3:

 a) Write a function, `binarySearch(…)`, that accepts a sorted array of integers (non-increasing/decreasing order) and a key. The function returns the index of the last occurrence of the key in the array. If the key is not found in the array, it returns -1. The Time Complexity of the function shall be O(log N).

b) Write `main(…)` function to test the function written in part a) above.
