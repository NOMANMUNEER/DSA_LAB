# Problem Solving

## Problem 1

### a) Fibonacci Function

Write a function `Fibonacci` that accepts a positive number `n` and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
### b) Test the Fibonacci Program

Test the `Fibonacci` function by writing a `main()` function that prints the result for a given input.

#### Example:
- Parameter: `6`
- Return value: `8`

### c) Time Complexity of Fibonacci Function

What is the time complexity of the Fibonacci function written in part a)?


## Problem 2

### a) Print Fraction Function

Write a function that accepts a pointer to a `struct` (Fraction) and prints the fraction.

### b) Print Fractions from an Array of Pointers

Write a function that accepts an array of pointers to `Fraction` (struct) and prints the fractions by calling the function written in part a).

### c) Testing the Program

Write a `main()` function to test your program.

### d) Time Complexity of the `printFractions` Function

What is the time complexity of the function written in part b)?



## Problem 3

### a) Binary Search Function

Write a function `BinarySearch` that accepts an array of integers, sorted in increasing order, and a key. It returns the index at which the key occurs in the array, and -1 if it does not exist.

### b) Testing the Binary Search Program

Write a `main()` function to test your program.

### c) Time Complexity of the Binary Search Function

What is the time complexity of the `BinarySearch` function written in part a)?
